# Status of the project

## Development
This project is now developed as part of the [AI Navigation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ai.navigation@latest) package. Please add that package to your project in order to continue building the NavMesh using these components and to get access to newer versions.

The content of this repository remains available for older Unity versions but no further development will be made here.

# Using This Repository

## Components for Runtime NavMesh Building

Here we introduce four components for the navigation system:

* __NavMeshSurface__ – for building and enabling a NavMesh surface for one agent type.
* __NavMeshModifier__ – affects the NavMesh generation of NavMesh area types, based on the transform hierarchy.
* __NavMeshModifierVolume__ – affects the NavMesh generation of NavMesh area types, based on volume.
* __NavMeshLink__ – connects same or different NavMesh surfaces for one agent type.

These components comprise the high level controls for building and using NavMeshes at runtime as well as edit time.

Detailed information can be found in the [Documentation](Documentation) section or in the [NavMesh building components](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/NavMesh-BuildingComponents.html) section of the Unity Manual.
